This project was started to create a simple, light-weight and quick API for Drupal / Moodle integration.  Specifically, we wanted to be able to display various kinds of Moodle information within a Drupal site, starting with course data.

Although developed for use with Drupal, there is nothing about the API that is Drupal-specific, and hence it can be used by any client code.
